Several problems have been reported against this repository. Each is described below under its own heading. Fix all of them.

## Issue 1

Model Field.__hash__() should be immutable.
Description
	
Field.__hash__ changes value when a field is assigned to a model class.
This code crashes with an AssertionError:
from django.db import models
f = models.CharField(max_length=200)
d = {f: 1}
class Book(models.Model):
	title = f
assert f in d
The bug was introduced in #31750.
It's unlikely to have been encountered because there are few use cases to put a field in a dict *before* it's assigned to a model class. But I found a reason to do so whilst implementing #26472 and the behaviour had me stumped for a little.
IMO we can revert the __hash__ change from #31750. Objects with the same hash are still checked for equality, which was fixed in that ticket. But it's bad if an object's hash changes, since it breaks its use in dicts.

## Issue 2

On databases lacking XOR, Q(…) ^ Q(…) ^ Q(…) wrongly interpreted as exactly-one rather than parity
Description
	
On databases that don’t natively support XOR, such as PostgreSQL, Django generates incorrect fallback SQL for Q(…) ^ Q(…) ^ Q(…) with more than 2 arguments. The ​correct interpretation, and the interpretation of databases natively supporting XOR (e.g. ​MySQL), is that a ^ b ^ c is true when an odd number of the arguments are true. But Django’s fallback interpretation is that a ^ b ^ c is true when exactly one argument is true:
>>> from django.db.models import Q
>>> from my_app.models import Client
>>> Client.objects.filter(Q(id=37)).count()
1
>>> Client.objects.filter(Q(id=37) ^ Q(id=37)).count()
0
>>> Client.objects.filter(Q(id=37) ^ Q(id=37) ^ Q(id=37)).count()
0
>>> Client.objects.filter(Q(id=37) ^ Q(id=37) ^ Q(id=37) ^ Q(id=37)).count()
0
>>> Client.objects.filter(Q(id=37) ^ Q(id=37) ^ Q(id=37) ^ Q(id=37) ^ Q(id=37)).count()
0
(Expected: 1, 0, 1, 0, 1.)
This was introduced in #29865.

## Issue 3

Migration optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField
Description
	
Let's consider the following operations: 
operations = [
	migrations.AddField(
		model_name="book",
		name="title",
		field=models.CharField(max_length=256, null=True),
	),
	migrations.AlterField(
		model_name="book",
		name="title",
		field=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True),
	),
	migrations.AlterField(
		model_name="book",
		name="title",
		field=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text="help"),
	),
	migrations.AlterField(
		model_name="book",
		name="title",
		field=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text="help", default=None),
	),
]
If I run the optimizer, I get only the AddField, as we could expect. However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:
optimizer.optimize(operations[1:], "books") 
[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,
 <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,
 <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]
Indeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. 
Is this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? 
Otherwise, would it make sense to add something like
		if isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(
			operation
		):
			return [operation]
